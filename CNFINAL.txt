------1.Peer to Peer(PC,PC) (send message)
{Theory:
Peer to peer is the relationship where the devices share the link equally. The
examples are ring and mesh topologies.
• In peer to peer architecture every node is connected to other node directly.
• Every computer node is referred as peer.
• Every peer provides services to other peers as well as uses services of them.
• There is no central server present
}

-----2.Star using hub (Hub,PC,PC,PC) (send message)
 {Theory:
Star topology is a network topology in which each network component is 
physically connected to a central node such as a router, hub or switch. ... 
When the central node receives a packet from a connecting node, it can 
pass the packet on to other nodes in the network. A star topology is also 
known as a star network.
• A network hub is a node that broadcasts data to every computer or Ethernetbased device connected to it.
• A device at the center of a star topology network. Hubs can be active (where 
they repeat signals set to them) or passive (where they do not repeat but 
merely split signals sent through them).
  }

------3.Star using switch (Switch,PC,PC,PC) (send message)
{Theory:
	In a star topology all nodes indirectly connect to each other through one or 
more switches . The switch acts as a central point through which all 
communications are passed. Large networks using a star topology are 
usually controlled by one or more servers . Hence, the client-server model 
usually uses a star topology.
• Does unicasting, multicasting and broadcasting

-------4.Bus using switch (Switch-4, PC-4) (command promt: ping 1.1.1.1)
{
   Theory:
A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a 
common half-duplex link called a bus. A host on a bus network is called a station. In 
a bus network, every station will receive all network traffic, and the traffic generated 
by each station has equal transmission priority.
• All nodes are connected to a Single Cable.
• If backbone cable is broken, Entire N/W fails.
• Easy to Install. Less Cabling is Required.
}

--------5.Mesh using switch(Switch-5, PC-5)(command promt: ping 1.1.1.1)
{Theory:
• Computers are Interconnected.
• Dedicated Link between each Node.
• More Cabling is Required.
• Highly Reliable Network.
}

--------6.Ring using switch(Switch-4, PC-4(command promt: ping 1.1.1.1)

-------7.Hybrid using switch(Switch-7,PC-7) (Switches are binary tree structure)
{Theory:
Bus + Star Topologies (Also called as Tree).
• Top node is called as Root and other are Descendants.
• One path exists between any two nodes.
• Easily Scalable
}

---------8.Switch using Telenet(Switch-1,PC-1(1.1.1.1))

Switch commads in CLI:
enable
configure terminal
enable password rgukt
interface vlan1
IP address 10.10.10.1 255.0.0
no shutdown
exit
line vty 0 2 
password rgukt
login
exit
exit
write memory

Commands at PC to access switch(cmd promt):
telnet 10.10.10.1
Yser Access Verification
password:rgukt
Switch> enable 
password:rgukt
Switch# config
Switch# exit

{
Theory:
• Telnet enables a user to manage a device remotely.
• Telnet is a protocol used to connect to switches and other devices in your network.
• Telnet provides a connection from a computer to a remote switch.
• The connection allows access to make changes to the device without actually having to be 
on site.
}

-------9.Router using Telnet (Router-1(4331),Pc-1 (1.1.1.1))

Commads at router (CLI)
enable
config terminal
enable password rgukt
interface Gig0/0/0
IP adress 10.10.10.1 255.0.0.0
no shutdown
line vty 0 9
password rgukt
login 
exit
exit
write memory

Commads At PC cmd promt
telnet 10.10.10.1
password:
enable
password:
config

{Theory:
• Telnet enables a user to manage a device remotely.
• A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer 
networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.}



-------10.ARP Using Cisco Packet(Switch,Server,PC-2)
   set IP of 2PCs
   click Search Icon put on PC and select ARP(do same to second pc)
   click on pc and commond prompt
   ->arp -a
   ->ping ___(other pc ip)
   -->arp -a 

-------11.Connection of 2 different networks using Router(Router-1(4331), switcH(2960)-2, pc-8) (give ip to gig/0/0/0(<127) and gig0/0/1(>127) to router
and give the same gateway of all pc should same and also Ip addrerss but last one should change (10.11.12.1)  (192.168.1.1) )
CLI commands (router):
enable 
config terminal
interface Gig0/0/0
IP address 10.11.12.10 255.255.0.0
no shutdown
exit
write memory

PC cmd promt:
ping 160.160.1.2

{Theory:
• Network Layer Device that forward the packets between networks.
• Used to connect two Different Networks.
• Works on IP addresses.
• Maintains Routing Table.}


------12.Cofig of DHCP service on Router
(Switch-1,Router-1,PC-4) (Set DHCP to all pcs)

commands of CLI(router):
enable 
config terminal
interface gig0/0/0
IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit

ip DHCP pool MyNetwork
network 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
default-server 192.168.11.1
dns-server 10.10.10.1
exit
exit
write memorey
(check IPs of pcs)





------13.DHCP server using Cisco Packet
(PC-2,Switch,server)
*set DHCP to all PCs
*Set ip address and dns address same for server. And also set a gateway
*Goto Server->Services->DHCP and put IP address starting from ex:-10.10.11.1
*Check the adderesses of pcs

-----14.DNS server configuration using cisco packet tracer
    (PC-2,Switch,Server)
*Set ip address and dns address same for server. And also set a gateway
*Set IP for pcs
*Goto Server->services->HTTP->edit
*Goto Server->Services->DNS->enterName->Server IP Address
*PC->Desktop->Web browser->URL(Server IP address)




------15.Email using packet tracer software
(Server,Router,Switch,PC-2)
*Set Class-c Ip address and default gatewahys for Sever and PCs 
*Router Congig  Gig0/0/0 and Gig0/0/1 default gateways of server and pcs respectively (Note: Ensure it is oN)
*Goto Server->Services->Email
*Add user name password according to number of pcs
*cofig email in each pc
*Send mail(compose) to one pc to other pc
*Check in other pc that the mail is recived or not.
